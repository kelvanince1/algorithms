// Which search should be used for:

// 1) If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare
// ---> BFS

// 2) If the tree is very wide
//  ---> DFS

// 3) If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
//  ---> DFS

// 4) Determining if a path exists between two nodes
//  ---> DFS

// 5) If the solution is not far from the root of the tree
//  ---> BFS

// 6) Finding the shortest path
// ---> BFS
